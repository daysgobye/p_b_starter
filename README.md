Kick off your project with this boilerplate. This starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files done and all of our componets 


## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the our starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the the purple + bold starter
    gatsby new purple_bold https://github.com/daysgobye/p_b_starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd purple_bold/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
